# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction

A machine learning web application that predicts forest cover types using cartographic variables. The project uses Random Forest classification to analyze and predict different types of forest covers in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.

## 📊 Overview

This interactive dashboard provides comprehensive analysis and prediction capabilities for forest cover types based on various geographical and cartographic variables. The application features:

- **Real-time Predictions**: Predict forest cover types using various terrain parameters
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore relationships between different geographical features
- **Detailed Analysis**: Examine the impact of soil types, elevation, and other factors
- **Model Performance Metrics**: View accuracy, precision, and F1 scores
